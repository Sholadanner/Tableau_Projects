# Global Population Analysis (1950â€“2025)  

This project examines **historical and current global population trends** using data sourced from the [U.S. Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov). By analyzing population growth, fertility rates, and demographic distributions over time, this study explores the factors shaping global population dynamics.  

## **Project Objective**  
- Identify the most populous countries and continents in 2025.  
- Compare historical and modern population growth trends (1950â€“2025).  
- Analyze the rate of population growth and its driving factors.

## **Key Insights**  

### **1. Global Population in 2025**  
- As of **January 2025**, the world population stands at **8,127,318,404**.  
- This marks a **0.88% increase** from the previous year.  
- Despite the growth, the **birth rate has been steadily declining** from 1950 to 2025.  

### **2. Most Populous Countries**  
- **India**: **1,419,316,933** people.  
- **China**: **1,407,181,209** people.  
- **India and China together account for 34.8% of the global population.**  

### **3. Most Populous Continents**  
- **Asia**: **4,766,049,993** people (**58.6% of the world population**).  
- **Africa**: **1,526,237,868** people.  
- **While Africa trails Asia in total population, it is the worldâ€™s fastest-growing region.**  

### **4. Fertility Rates by Continent**  
- **Africa** has the highest fertility rate at **4.09 children per woman**.  
- Other continents show significantly lower fertility rates:  
  - **Asia**: **1.92**  
  - **Americas**: **1.78**  
  - **Europe**: **1.51**  
  - **Oceania**: **2.28**  

### **5. Factors Influencing Population Growth**  
- **Fertility rate and growth rate** show a weak **positive correlation (0.22)**.  
- **Life expectancy and growth rate** have a weak **negative correlation (-0.15)**.  
- **GDP per capita and growth rate** have a **moderate negative correlation (-0.32)**, indicating that wealthier regions tend to have lower growth rates.  

---  
## **Conclusion**  
This analysis highlights key trends in global population dynamics:  
- **India surpasses China** as the most populous country in 2025.  
- **Asia remains dominant in population share**, but Africa's high fertility rate suggests rapid future growth.  
- The **global birth rate is declining**, influenced by economic development and life expectancy trends.  
- **Lower GDP per capita** tends to be associated with **higher growth rates**, particularly in Africa.

## ðŸ’» **Future Scope**  
- Analyze urban vs. rural population distribution and migration trends.  
- Explore the impact of climate change on population distribution.  
- Use predictive modeling to estimate population trends beyond 2025.
