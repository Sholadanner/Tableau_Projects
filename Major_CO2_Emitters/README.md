# üåç Carbon Emissions Analysis (1750‚Äì2023)  

This project explores data on **historical and current carbon emissions** sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org). By analyzing trends and contributions over time, it sheds light on the role of countries and regions in contributing to global CO‚ÇÇ emissions.  

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Objective**  
- Identify major contributors to global carbon emissions in 2023.  
- Compare historical and modern emission trends (1750‚Äì2023).  
- Explore per capita emissions and the relationship between GDP and carbon emissions.
