# Moon Phases and Tidal Patterns Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes how the **phases of the moon** affect the **rise and fall of tides** in **San Carlo, California, USA**. The tidal data was sourced from [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/), while the moon phase data was obtained from the [Griffith Observatory](https://griffithobservatory.org/). The data was merged and cleaned using **Excel 2013** and visualized with **Tableau** to uncover meaningful patterns.

## Dataset
- **Tidal Data:** [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov/)
- **Moon Phase Data:** [Griffith Observatory](https://griffithobservatory.org/)

## Tools Used
- **Excel 2013:** Data cleaning and merging
- **Tableau:** Data visualization (line chart and heatmap)

## Data Processing
1. **Data Collection:** Acquired tidal and moon phase data from reputable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Removed inconsistencies, handled missing values, and formatted data in Excel.
3. **Data Merging:** Integrated tidal and moon phase datasets for comprehensive analysis.
4. **Visualization:** Created a **line chart** and a **heatmap** in Tableau.

## Visualizations

### Line Chart
- **Findings:**  
  - **New Moon** and **Full Moon** phases showed the **highest tidal ranges**.
  - Even the **lowest tidal range** during these phases was **higher** than the **highest tidal range** observed during the **First Quarter** and **Third Quarter** moon phases.

### Heatmap
- **Findings:**  
  - **High tidal intensity** during the **New Moon** and **Full Moon** phases.
  - **Lower tidal intensity** during the **First Quarter** and **Third Quarter** phases

## Key Insights
- **Spring Tides:** Occur during **New** and **Full Moons**, where the gravitational pull of the moon and sun align, causing extreme tidal ranges.
- **Neap Tides:** Occur during **First** and **Third Quarters**, where gravitational forces partially cancel out, resulting in minimal tidal variations.

## Conclusion
The analysis confirms a **strong correlation** between moon phases and tidal ranges:
- **New Moon & Full Moon:** High tidal ranges (spring tides)
- **First & Third Quarter:** Low tidal ranges (neap tides)

These insights are crucial for **coastal management**, **marine navigation**, and **environmental monitoring**.

## Future Work
- Analyzing tidal patterns across multiple locations.
- Incorporating weather data to assess additional environmental impacts.
- Using advanced statistical models for predictive tidal analysis.
