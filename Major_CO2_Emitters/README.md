# üåç Carbon Emissions Analysis (1750‚Äì2023)  

This project explores data on **historical and current carbon emissions** sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org). By analyzing trends and contributions over time, it sheds light on the role of countries and regions in contributing to global CO‚ÇÇ emissions.  

## üõ†Ô∏è **Project Objective**  
- Identify major contributors to global carbon emissions in 2023.  
- Compare historical and modern emission trends (1750‚Äì2023).  
- Explore per capita emissions and the relationship between GDP and carbon emissions.

## üìä **Key Insights**  

### **1. 2023 Annual CO‚ÇÇ Emissions**  
- **China**: **11.9 billion tons** (31.5% of the global total) ‚Äì the leading emitter.  
- **United States**: **4.9 billion tons** (13%).  
- **European Union**: **2.8 billion tons** (7.45%).  
- Together, **China, USA, and EU** account for over **half of global emissions**.  
- **China emits 4 times more CO‚ÇÇ than the combined total of Africa, South America, and Oceania.**

### **2. Historical Emissions (1750‚Äì2023)**  
- The **United States** tops the historical contribution with **431 billion tons** of CO‚ÇÇ.  
- **China** follows with **272 billion tons**, and **Russia** with **121 billion tons**.  
- The cumulative buildup of CO‚ÇÇ is largely tied to industrialized nations.

### **3. Emissions Per Capita**  
- **Qatar** ranks highest with **38.8 tons/person**.  
- **Brunei**: **28.6 tons/person**.  
- **Bahrain**: **23.3 tons/person**.  
- Notably, none of the top emitters by volume (China, USA, EU) make the top 10 on a per capita basis, revealing disparities in individual contributions.

### **4. Correlation Between GDP and Emissions**  
- A strong correlation (**0.79**) exists between high GDP and high per capita emissions, emphasizing the environmental cost of economic wealth.

## üåü **Conclusion**  
This analysis highlights the complexities of carbon emissions:  
- **Today‚Äôs major contributors** (China, USA, EU) dominate annual totals, while **historical accountability** shifts the focus heavily toward the USA.  
- A **per capita lens** unveils inequalities, where smaller, affluent nations lead the way in emissions per person.  
- Addressing climate change demands a **global yet fair approach**, balancing historical responsibility with sustainable development.
